		<div style="margin: 35px auto 15px auto; max-width: 800px;">I started All Aboard Toys for the toy train enthusiast. After searching the Internet in vain for one store where I could buy my kids the toy train vehicles, track, complete systems and accessories they wanted, I decided to launch All Aboard Toys. I believe All Aboard Toys offers the most extensive on-line selection of toy trains and accessories available on the Internet.</div>

		<div style="margin: 20px auto 25px auto; max-width: 800px;">All Aboard Toys stands behind your order 100%. If for any reason you are dissatisfied, just return the product for a full refund! We also now offer a complete on-line tracking system whereby you can track your order's status as it moves to your location.</div>
